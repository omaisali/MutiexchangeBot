# ⚠️ Vercel Deployment Warning

## Why Vercel Won't Work

**Vercel is NOT suitable for this trading bot** because:

### 1. Serverless Function Limitations
- **Execution Time Limit**: 10 seconds (free) / 60 seconds (pro)
- **No Long-Running Processes**: Functions must complete quickly
- **Cold Starts**: Functions spin down after inactivity

### 2. This Bot Requires:
- ✅ **24/7 Continuous Monitoring** - TP/SL monitoring threads
- ✅ **Persistent State** - Position tracking, order management
- ✅ **Background Jobs** - Price checking every 2-5 seconds
- ✅ **Always-On Webhook** - Must listen continuously for TradingView signals

### 3. What Happens on Vercel:
- ❌ Monitoring threads will timeout
- ❌ Webhook server can't run continuously
- ❌ Position state will be lost
- ❌ TP/SL monitoring will fail

## ✅ Use These Instead

### Recommended: **Railway** (Easiest)
- Free tier available
- Supports long-running processes
- Auto-deploy from GitHub
- **5-minute setup** - See `RAILWAY_DEPLOY.md`

### Alternative: **Render**
- Free tier available
- Good for background workers
- Easy deployment

### Alternative: **DigitalOcean App Platform**
- $5/month starting
- Full control
- Reliable

## Quick Start with Railway

1. Push code to GitHub
2. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
3. New Project → Deploy from GitHub
4. Add environment variables
5. Done! ✅

See `RAILWAY_DEPLOY.md` for detailed steps.

## If You Still Want to Try Vercel

**It won't work**, but if you want to experiment:

1. You'd need to completely rewrite the bot to:
   - Use serverless functions only
   - Store state in database (not memory)
   - Use external cron jobs for monitoring
   - Restructure everything

2. This would require:
   - Major code refactoring
   - Database setup (Vercel Postgres)
   - External monitoring service
   - Much more complexity

**Recommendation**: Use Railway or Render instead - they're designed for this use case.
