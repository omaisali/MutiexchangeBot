# MEXC API Credentials Verification

## Current Status
- ✅ Signature format: **CORRECT** (timestamp only, recvWindow added after)
- ✅ Signature generation: **CORRECT** (matches expected values)
- ❌ MEXC API: **REJECTING** signature (Code 700002)

## This Means
The signature is mathematically correct, but MEXC is rejecting it. This typically indicates:

### 1. API Key/Secret Mismatch
The API key and secret in Railway might not match what's configured in MEXC.

**Verify:**
- Log into MEXC → API Management
- Find API key: `mx0vglnDmOEpXsddhU`
- Check if the API secret matches: `49402f94c447475993cbe04bb147489c`
- **Important:** API secret is only shown once when created. If you're not 100% sure, you may need to create a new API key.

### 2. API Key Status
The API key might be:
- ❌ **Expired** (keys expire after 90 days if IP whitelist is empty)
- ❌ **Revoked** or **Deleted**
- ❌ **Inactive** or **Disabled**

**Check in MEXC:**
- Go to API Management
- Verify key status is **Active**
- Check expiration date
- Verify key hasn't been deleted

### 3. API Key Permissions
The API key might not have the required permissions.

**Required Permissions:**
- ✅ **Account** - View Account Details
- ✅ **Trade** - View Order Details, Trade

**Verify in MEXC:**
- Check API key permissions
- Ensure both "Account" and "Trade" are enabled
- Save if you made changes

### 4. API Key Type
The API key might be for a different account type.

**Verify:**
- Ensure key is for **Spot Trading** (not just Futures)
- Check if key is for main account or sub-account

## Recommended Actions

### Option 1: Create New API Key (Recommended)
1. Log into MEXC → API Management
2. **Create a new API key**
3. **Copy the secret immediately** (it won't be shown again)
4. Enable **Account** and **Trade** permissions
5. **Leave IP whitelist empty** (for Railway)
6. Update Railway environment variables with new key/secret
7. Update dashboard with new credentials

### Option 2: Verify Existing Key
1. Check API key status in MEXC
2. Verify permissions are enabled
3. Check if key has expired
4. Verify secret matches exactly (if you have it saved)

### Option 3: Check MEXC Account Status
1. Verify your MEXC account is active
2. Check if there are any account restrictions
3. Verify account verification status

## Test Command

After updating credentials, test locally:
```bash
export MEXC_API_KEY='your_new_key'
export MEXC_API_SECRET='your_new_secret'
python3 test_mexc_railway_format.py
```

## Why This Happens

When signature format is correct but MEXC rejects it, it's almost always:
1. **Wrong API secret** (most common)
2. **Expired API key**
3. **Missing permissions**
4. **Key/secret mismatch** (key and secret don't belong together)

The signature math is correct, so the issue is with the credentials themselves.
