# TradingView Alert Setup Guide

## Quick Setup Steps

### 1. Webhook Endpoint URL

Your webhook endpoint is:
```
https://web-production-93165.up.railway.app/webhook
```

### 2. Setting Up TradingView Alerts

#### Step 1: Open Your Indicator on TradingView
1. Go to [TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com)
2. Open a chart with your indicator loaded (`WT + Ideal BB + RSI`)
3. Make sure the indicator is visible and working

#### Step 2: Create an Alert
1. Click the **Alert** button (bell icon) at the top of the chart
2. Click **"Create Alert"**

#### Step 3: Configure Alert Conditions
1. **Condition**: Select your indicator
   - Look for: `WT + Ideal BB + RSI`
   - Select: **"Strategy Buy Signal (JSON)"** for BUY signals
   - OR **"Strategy Sell Signal (JSON)"** for SELL signals

2. **Alert Name**: Give it a descriptive name
   - Example: `Trading Bot - BUY Signals`
   - Example: `Trading Bot - SELL Signals`

3. **Expiration**: Set to **"No Expiration"** (or your preferred duration)

4. **Webhook URL**: Enter your webhook endpoint
   ```
   https://web-production-93165.up.railway.app/webhook
   ```

5. **Message Format**: The indicator automatically sends JSON format
   - The message will be: `BUY` or `SELL`
   - The webhook handler will parse the full JSON payload automatically

#### Step 4: Save the Alert
1. Click **"Create"** to save the alert
2. The alert will now trigger when conditions are met

### 3. Testing the Webhook

#### Test with cURL (Optional)
```bash
# Test BUY signal
curl -X POST https://web-production-93165.up.railway.app/webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "symbol": "BTCUSDT",
    "time": 1234567890,
    "signal": "BUY",
    "price": {
      "close": 50000.00
    }
  }'

# Test SELL signal
curl -X POST https://web-production-93165.up.railway.app/webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "symbol": "BTCUSDT",
    "time": 1234567890,
    "signal": "SELL",
    "price": {
      "close": 51000.00
    }
  }'
```

#### Check Dashboard
1. Go to your dashboard: https://web-production-93165.up.railway.app/
2. Check the **"TradingView Signal Status"** section
3. You should see:
   - **Status**: Connected (green)
   - **Last Signal**: Time of last signal
   - **Recent Signals**: Table showing all received signals

### 4. Alert Configuration Details

#### For BUY Signals:
- **Alert Condition**: `Strategy Buy Signal (JSON)`

### 5. Signal Requirements

For a signal to be sent, **ALL** of these conditions must be met:

#### BUY Signal Requirements:
1. ✅ **WaveTrend**: WT1 crosses above WT2 (green dot appears)
2. ✅ **Bollinger Bands**: Price is above Moving Average
3. ✅ **RSI**: RSI is between 54-82 (buy range)

### 6. Monitoring Signals

#### Dashboard Features:
- **Real-time Status**: Shows if webhook is receiving signals
- **Signal History**: View all recent signals in a table
- **Trade Execution**: See if trades were executed successfully
- **Error Logging**: View any errors in signal processing

#### Check Logs (Railway):
1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Click on your service
3. View **Logs** tab to see webhook requests in real-time

### 7. Troubleshooting

#### No Signals Received?
1. ✅ Check that alerts are **enabled** in TradingView
2. ✅ Verify webhook URL is correct: `https://web-production-93165.up.railway.app/webhook`
3. ✅ Check that all 3 indicator conditions are met (WT + BB + RSI)
4. ✅ Check Railway logs for any errors
5. ✅ Test webhook with cURL (see above)

#### Signals Not Executing Trades?
1. ✅ Check that exchange is **connected** in dashboard
2. ✅ Verify API keys are correct and have trading permissions
3. ✅ Check that exchange is **enabled** in dashboard
4. ✅ Review error messages in dashboard logs

#### Webhook Returns Error?
- **400 Bad Request**: Invalid signal format
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Server-side error (check logs)
- **Connection Refused**: Server might be down (check Railway status)

### 8. Webhook Payload Format

The indicator sends JSON payloads with this structure:
```json
{
  "symbol": "BTCUSDT",
  "time": 1234567890,
  "signal": "BUY",
  "indicators": {
    "wt": {
      "flag": true,
      "wt1": 12.5,
      "wt2": 10.2,
      "cross_type": "BULLISH",
      "window_active": true
    },
    "bb": {
      "flag": true,
      "upper": 52000,
      "lower": 48000,
      "basis": 50000,
      "ma_value": 50000,
      "percent_b": 0.5
    },
    "rsi": {
      "value": 65.5,
      "buy_threshold_min": 54.0,
      "buy_threshold_max": 82.0,
      "sell_threshold_min": 27.0,
      "sell_threshold_max": 43.0,
      "condition_met": true
    }
  },
  "price": {
    "close": 50000.00,
    "open": 49900.00,
    "high": 50100.00,
    "low": 49800.00
  },
  "strategy": {
    "entry_type": "NEXT_CANDLE_OPEN",
    "all_conditions_met": true
  }
}
```

### 9. Multiple Alerts Setup

You can create **two separate alerts**:
1. **One for BUY signals** → Uses "Strategy Buy Signal (JSON)"
2. **One for SELL signals** → Uses "Strategy Sell Signal (JSON)"

Both can use the same webhook URL. The server will automatically detect the signal type.

### 10. Security Notes

⚠️ **Important Security Considerations:**
- Your webhook endpoint is **public** (no authentication by default)
- Consider adding authentication if needed (IP whitelist, API key, etc.)
- Railway provides HTTPS automatically (secure connection)
- Monitor your logs for suspicious activity
