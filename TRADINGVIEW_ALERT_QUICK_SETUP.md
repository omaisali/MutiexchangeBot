# TradingView Alert Quick Setup Guide

## Step-by-Step Alert Configuration

### Step 1: Alert Condition (Settings Tab)

**Current (Wrong):**
- Condition: `Price` → `Crossing` → `WT+BB+RSI` → `WT1`

**Change to (Correct):**

1. Click on the **Condition** dropdown
2. Select your indicator: **"WT + Ideal BB + RSI"** (or "WT+BB+RSI")
3. Then select one of these alert conditions:
   - **"Strategy Buy Signal (JSON)"** - For BUY signals
   - **"Strategy Sell Signal (JSON)"** - For SELL signals

**OR** you can use the alternative:
   - **"Strategy Buy Signal (Webhook)"** - For BUY signals
   - **"Strategy Sell Signal (Webhook)"** - For SELL signals

### Step 2: Interval Settings

- **Interval**: Keep as **"Same as chart"** ✅
- **Timeframe**: Use your chart's timeframe (e.g., "24 minutes" is fine)

### Step 3: Trigger Frequency

**Recommended: "Once per bar close"** ✅
- This ensures signals only fire when the candle closes
- Prevents duplicate signals
- Matches the indicator's "closed candle" logic

**Options:**
- ✅ **"Once per bar close"** - Best for this strategy (recommended)
- ⚠️ "Once per bar" - May trigger multiple times
- ⚠️ "Only once" - Only fires once ever
- ⚠️ "Once per minute" - Too frequent

### Step 4: Expiration

- Set to **"No Expiration"** (or your preferred date)
- This keeps the alert active indefinitely

### Step 5: Webhook URL (Message Tab)

1. Click on the **"Message"** tab
2. Scroll down to **"Webhook URL"** field
3. Enter your webhook URL:
   ```
   https://web-production-93165.up.railway.app/webhook
   ```
4. **Message** field: You can leave it as `BUY` or `SELL`, or leave empty
   - The indicator automatically sends the full JSON payload

### Step 6: Notifications (Optional)

1. Click on the **"Notifications"** tab
2. Enable notifications if you want to be notified:
   - ✅ Email
   - ✅ Mobile Push
   - ✅ Desktop Popup

### Step 7: Create the Alert

1. Click **"Create"** button
2. The alert is now active!
